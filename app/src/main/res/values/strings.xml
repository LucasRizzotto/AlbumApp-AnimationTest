Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n
How I wonder what you are!\n
Up above the world so high,\n
Like a diamond in the sky.\n
\n
When the blazing sun is gone,\n
When he nothing shines upon,\n
Then you show your little light,\n
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.\n
\n
Then the traveller in the dark\n
Thanks you for your tiny sparks;\n
He could not see which way to go,\n
If you did not twinkle so.\n
\n
In the dark blue sky you keep,\n
And often through my curtains peep,\n
For you never shut your eye\n
\'Till the sun is in the sky.\n
\n
As your bright and tiny spark\n
Lights the traveller in the dark,\n
Though I know not what you are,\n
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

    <string name="block_of_text">How can you see into my eyes, like open doors Leading you down into my core Where I\'ve become so numb, without a soul My spirit\'s sleeping somewhere cold Until you find it there and lead it back home Wake me up, wake me up inside I can\'t wake up, Wake me up inside, save me, Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up Bid my blood to run, I can\'t wake up Before I come undone, save me Save me from the nothing I\'ve become Now that I know what I\'m without You can\'t just leave me Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life Wake me up, wake me up inside I can\'t wake up, Wake me up inside, save me, Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up Bid my blood to run, I can\'t wake up Before I come undone, save me Save meâ€¦ Full lyrics on Google Play</string>
